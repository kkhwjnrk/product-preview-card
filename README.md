# Frontend Mentor - Product Card Preview Challenge 👨‍💻🛍️

This project is my solution to the Product Card Preview challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to create a product card preview and to do so, I utilized HTML and Sass, along with implementing Flexbox and Grid, to ensure the design was responsive across various screen sizes.

I implemented a mobile-first design approach, ensuring the design was optimized for smaller screens before scaling to larger ones. I used Sass to write more efficient and organized CSS code.
